# Unique shipping countries:
unique(dt.supply.chain$`Customer Country`)
# Puerto Rico and EE. UU., which is the Spanish version of USA.
# Seeing as Puerto Rico is part of the US, the following shall be more useful:
head(unique(dt.supply.chain$`Customer State`))
length(unique(dt.supply.chain$`Customer State`))
# Orders have been shipped from 46 unique US states, such as: Puerto Rico,
# California, New York, Florida, Massachusetts and Illinois.

# Unique destination countries:
head(unique(dt.supply.chain$`Order Country`))
length(unique(dt.supply.chain$`Order Country`))
# There are 164 distinct destination countries, such as Indonesia, India,
# Australia, China, Japan and South Korea.

# The shipping US stores belong to...

# The distinct products shipped:

# apparel, DVDs and video games.

mean(dt.supply.chain$`Product Price`)
min(dt.supply.chain$`Product Price`)
max(dt.supply.chain$`Product Price`)
sd(dt.supply.chain$`Product Price`)
# The mean product price is $141.23, with the cheapest product costing $9.99 and
# the most expensive being $1999.99. The standard deviation is $139.73.

# However, the above prices were often discounted!
mean(dt.supply.chain$`Order Item Discount Rate`)

sd(dt.supply.chain$`Order Item Discount Rate`)
# The average discount was 10% on the product price. The maximum was 25%, with a
# standard deviation of 7%.

# Oftentimes, sales even came at a big loss. Here are some profit indicators:
mean(dt.supply.chain$`Order Profit Per Order`)
min(dt.supply.chain$`Order Profit Per Order`)
max(dt.supply.chain$`Order Profit Per Order`)
sd(dt.supply.chain$`Order Profit Per Order`)
# The average profit per sale was $21.97. The highest earnings per sale were
# $911.8. The biggest loss comes in at $4275. The standard deviation is $104.43.
